#Python code that determines the microduplication syndrome based on inputted chromosomal abnormalities.
# Steps:
# 1. Type in name
# 2. Type in your sex chromosomes without the extra one (XX or XY; XXY is invalid).
# 3. Type in either "yes" or "no" for question about an extra copy of chromosomes. (capitalization does not matter).
# 4. If you have an extra copy of a particular chromosome, type in the number of the chromosome in which this extra copy exists.
# 5. Learn about your disorder!
